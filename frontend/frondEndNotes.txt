1. We first set up the pages for each page.

2. TailwindCSS +  *DaisyUI* = makes it fast and easy

i. App.jsx vs Main.jsx
    -* main.jsx - It is the Main Entry Point of your application - basically where everything starts.
    It also imports global styles and wraps your app (like <BrowserRouter/>)
    <BrowserRouter> // It makes routing (page navigation) work in a React app like: /page, /note/:id
     <App />
    </BrowserRouter> 
So, main.jsx = setup + entry point

    -* app.jsx - It is the heart of the UI (User Interface).
    Inside, we define the routes (like /login, /dashboard, /homepage),
            we set the layout (like Navbar or Footer)  //these are static so when we go /home -> /profile, both of them stay static
    <Navbar /> → always shown on top
    <Routes> → where your actual “page content” switches
    <Footer /> → stays visible at the bottom

File	Purpose	Think of it as
main.jsx	Starts the app, connects React to HTML	“The power switch” ⚡
App.jsx	Holds the actual UI, routes, components	“The brain” 🧠

So,
main.jsx - Starts the app
app.jsx - Holds the actual UI, routes, components
