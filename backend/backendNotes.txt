# MiddleWare. -------
- MiddleWare is a function between req and res.
- MiddleWare runs between "req" coming in and "res" going out.
- Think of it like a secuirity guard or a checkpoint.
When someone hits an API route like -> POST /api/users/login,
Every incoming request first goes through middleware functions before your route handler actually runs.

Client → Middleware → Controller (route logic) → Response

Some example of middleWare functions -
* Authentication
* Logging requests
* Error limiting
* Rate Limiting (how many requests can be sent in a given period of time)
* Parsing JSON (express.json()). // middleware that lets your Express server automatically read and use JSON data sent from the frontend.


// this middleWare will give me access to req.body (app.use(express.json() ))

Client <--res/req--> Server

# Rate limiting!  ------
- Rate limiting is a way to control how often someone can do something on a website or app.
e.g - how many times they can refresh a page, make a request to a API, or try to log in.

- Rate Limiting helps preventing spamming, abuse and Protecting servers from overwhelmed.
